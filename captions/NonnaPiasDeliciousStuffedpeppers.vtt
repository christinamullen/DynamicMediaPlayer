00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.916
<v Tony>You're making more sauce today?</v>

2
00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:11.506
<v ->Yes, 'cause I wanna make stuffed peppers.</v>

3
00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:13.889
<v ->Ah, stuffed peppers.</v>
<v ->And I need the sauce.</v>

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.980
<v ->I cooked the rice.</v>

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.930
And I cook with a little chunk of meat.

7
00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:25.597
(sauce sizzles in pan)

8
00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:29.580
And I put cheese.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.593
<v Tony>What kind of cheese, Pia?</v>

10
00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:32.426

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:36.573
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Little bit of water.</v>

12
00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:44.340
Just breaking it up a little bit?

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.260
<v ->Oh, I gotta break it up with the rice.</v>

14
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.093
You gotta learn how to make it.

15
00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:50.193
'Cause Grandma not gonna be here too long.

16
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.323
<v Tony>Where do you get these peppers?</v>

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.320
<v ->Farmer market.</v>
<v ->Farmer's market, right?</v>

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.213
You're the best.

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.140
Grandma, there's a spot, you rip this one.

20
00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.123
You don't have to cut it. (laughs)

21
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.626
What are you gonna do now?

22
00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:20.846
<v ->You gotta use the eggs.</v>

23
00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.805
You gotta broke in a glass and a dish

24
00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:24.105
'cause in case of the rot.

25
00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Tony>Ah, 'cause if it's a bad one,</v>

26
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.063
it ruins the whole meal, okay.

27
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.320
Mix everything with your hands.

28
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.820
<v ->Too much.</v>

29
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.010
My hands clean, Tony.

30
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.933
<v Tony>All right.</v>

31
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.591
That's it?

32
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:50.825
That's easy.

33
00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Pia>It's very easy.</v>

34
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Tony>Did you put the oil in the frying pan?</v>

35
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.803
<v ->Yes.</v>

36
00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:03.150
(peppers sizzle in pan)

37
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.384
<v Tony>Love to hear that sound.</v>

38
00:02:05.384 --> 00:02:07.134
<v ->I'm done, this one.</v>

39
00:02:08.064 --> 00:02:10.314

<v Tony>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:20.303

42
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.740
Ooh, you gonna put the fresh sauce?

43
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.213
Wow, yeah.

44
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.120
You're gonna make people hungry.

45
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Pia>Discipline, we have for dinner.</v>

46
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.429
We're having this, meatloaf-

47
00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:35.488
<v Tony>You're making me hungry now.</v>

48
00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.822
Look at that steam, smells good.

49
00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:38.655
<v ->Mama.</v>

50
00:02:42.043 --> 00:02:43.893

<v ->Easy.</v>
<v ->Very slow cooking.</v>

52
00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:48.542
<v Tony>Okay.</v>

53
00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:49.667
How's it look?

54
00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:50.665
<v ->Good.</v>

55
00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:52.712
<v ->Good?</v>
<v ->Yeah, cook.</v>

56
00:02:52.712 --> 00:02:53.786
Almost cooked.

57
00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Tony>Wow.</v>

58
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.347
