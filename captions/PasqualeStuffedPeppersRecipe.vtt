6
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.910
I got pecorino cheese.

8
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.370
I got one cup of rice.

9
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.597
It's arborio rice

10
00:00:21.597 --> 00:00:25.410
I got a pound and a half of pork.

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.300
It's shoulder pork.

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.270
I got my homemade sauce.

13
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.670
I got marjoran over here.

14
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.527
I got some fresh garlic from my garden.

15
00:00:35.527 --> 00:00:37.917
I got one onion,

16
00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:40.560
and fresh parsley from my garden.

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.500
Okay, we gotta start to chop the onion, garlic,

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.360
and I wanna start to fry.

19
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.510
Okay, now we start with a little oil,

20
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.080
I wanna saute the garlic, and the onion.

21
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.157
I got it right over here.

22
00:00:54.157 --> 00:00:57.990
It gives good taste for the stock I gotta make.

23
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.990
I mix it together with the rise, and the meat.

24
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.030
Okay, now the onions are ready.

25
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.800
They don't gotta be burned.

26
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.960
I want 'em nice white like this.

27
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.723
And we put it right over here together with a meat.

28
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.000
And now I give it a little mix.

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.240
Everybody likes lot of garlic and onion, especially me.

30
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.890
I like a lot garlic.

31
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.940
And now we gotta put in all the rest of the stuff,

32
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.890
then mix together.

33
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.723
Okay?

34
00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:32.989
Now this parsley, I got so many parsleys.

35
00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:37.989
I cover it every night, 'cause at nighttime it's cold.

36
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.440
I got parsley all year long.

37
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.273
Okay, now we put in the parsley.

38
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.140
I got over here the marjoran.

39
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.950
I got the salt

40
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.590
I put one, and two big spoonsfull of salt.

41
00:01:57.527 --> 00:02:01.983
Little spoon, okay, black pepper.

42
00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.093
I got my pecorino cheese.

43
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.290
I got my rice over here.

44
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.633
And we start like this.

45
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.793
The rice has boiled already.

46
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.360
Okay, now I gotta pour my sauce.

47
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.048
Now if I need more rice after, I can put more rice.

48
00:02:31.048 --> 00:02:32.790
It's enough for now.

49
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.233
I washed my hands already.

50
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.143
I wanna mix this by hand.

51
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.620
This in Italy, we do a lot of pepper

52
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.197
This in Italy (speaking in Italian).

53
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.203
Okay, I can put a little bit more ice.

54
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.100
Okay, we mix 'em up.

55
00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:06.501
(whistling)

56
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.870
Now it's time to taste.

57
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.027
Everybody says, "Pasquale, don't taste like this.

58
00:03:16.027 --> 00:03:17.727
"This is raw meat."

59
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.810
Forget about it.

60
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.140
I've eaten so much meat.

61
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.110
In Italy when we were killing the pig,

62
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.440
we would say like this (speaking Italian.)

63
00:03:31.897 --> 00:03:36.897
"The pig you warm up a little bit," we say, "and you eat."

64
00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.673
A little salt, baby.

65
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.380
Yeah, I need one spoon, good.

66
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.722
Now a little mix.

67
00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:51.900
You gotta taste.

68
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.386
If you don't taste after you cook,

69
00:03:55.386 --> 00:04:00.386
when you serve the people, they'll say, "It's got no salt,"

70
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.720
or, "It's too much salt."

71
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.430
Like this, you gotta taste.

72
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.370
Okay, now I finish this.

73
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.973
Okay, now we start with the spots,

74
00:04:10.973 --> 00:04:13.073
and I'll pour the sauce out of the bottom.

75
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.603
Make sure the sauce goes everyplace.

76
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.180
Good.

77
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.007
Okay, now I got a question of everybody.

78
00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:26.550
What's the male?

79
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.870
What's the female?

80
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.140
Now this over here, it's got four chick,

81
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.270
and this, it's got a three chick.

82
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.940
Now I wanna know, does somebody know,

83
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.415
what is the male, and what is the female?

84
00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:40.506
It's a question.

85
00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:45.506
Ah, I know, but I want everybody to know this.

86
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.870
Now let's start the stock.

87
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.360
And make sure they clean up really good.

88
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.540
Look, you see, take all the seeds out.

89
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.358
Lot of times, the pepper,

90
00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:59.580
it's got some bugs too inside, okay?

91
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.980
Make sure to clean them out good.

92
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.318
Okay, now I wanna finish with everything,

93
00:05:05.318 --> 00:05:07.713
and after, I show you the last step.

94
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.160
Okay, now it's time the put the hat, cappaluce.

95
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.560
Okay, we started with this one.

96
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.976
Nice.

97
00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:20.997
Now I put this on the top like this,

98
00:05:20.997 --> 00:05:24.120
and it covers everything, and won't burn.

99
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.810
Now this has gotta cook for one hour.

100
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.300
Okay, 'cause the meat, it's raw.

101
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.520
It's gotta cook for one hour.

102
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.413
I got 400 degree.

103
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.860
Okay

104
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.693
Good.

105
00:05:41.423 --> 00:05:43.410
Okay, it's one hour.

106
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.143
The pepper with the garlic.

107
00:05:51.324 --> 00:05:53.130
Oh, it's really hot.

108
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.865
Wow.

109
00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:57.540
Okay, look how nice it looks.

110
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.160
I wanna take it out.

111
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.903
Maybe this one.

112
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.363
They look nice.

113
00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:10.541
Mmmm.

114
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.013
Ooh, it's really hot.

115
00:06:18.868 --> 00:06:20.043
A little sauce.

116
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.303
My wine's gotta be ready to go.

117
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.463
Now, let's cut.

118
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.503
Look beautiful.

119
00:06:51.015 --> 00:06:51.848
Hmm.

120
00:06:51.848 --> 00:06:53.030
It's really, really good.

121
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.810
It taste like in Italy.

122
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.627
When I was in Italy, we would make this,

123
00:06:57.627 --> 00:07:00.990
and the pepper is perfectly cooked.

124
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.940

125
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.040

126
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.843
Thank you very much everybody.

127
00:07:11.043 --> 00:07:12.243
Salute, and ching ching.
